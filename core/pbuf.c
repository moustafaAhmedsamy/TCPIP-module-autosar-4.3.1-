 * Packet buffer management
 *
 * Packets are built from the pbuf data structure. It supports dynamic
 * memory allocation for packet contents or can reference externally
 * managed packet contents both in RAM and ROM. Quick allocation for
 * incoming packets is provided through pools with fixed sized pbufs.
 *
 * A packet may span over multiple pbufs, chained as a singly linked
 * list. This is called a "pbuf chain".
 *
 * Multiple packets may be queued, also using this singly linked list.
 * This is called a "packet queue".
 * 
 * So, a packet queue consists of one or more pbuf chains, each of
 * which consist of one or more pbufs. CURRENTLY, PACKET QUEUES ARE
 * NOT SUPPORTED!!! Use helper structs to queue multiple packets.
 * 
 * The differences between a pbuf chain and a packet queue are very
 * precise but subtle. 
 *
 * The last pbuf of a packet has a ->tot_len field that equals the
 * ->len field. It can be found by traversing the list. If the last
 * pbuf of a packet has a ->next field other than NULL, more packets
 * are on the queue.
 *
 * Therefore, looping through a pbuf of a single packet, has an
 * loop end condition (tot_len == p->len), NOT (next == NULL).
